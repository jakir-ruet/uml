### Unified Modeling Language (UML)
It's a standardized modeling language used to `visualize`, `specify`, `construct`, and document the artifacts of a software system. It provides a set of graphical notations to create a variety of models for system development, whether for analysis, design, or implementation.

#### [Types of UML diagrams](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/tutorial/uml)
UML uses elements and associates them in different ways to form diagrams that represent static, or structural aspects of a system, and behavioral diagrams, which capture the dynamic aspects of a system.

1. **Structural UML diagrams**
- [`Class Diagram`](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-class-diagram) The most commonly used UML diagram, and the principal foundation of any object-oriented solution. Classes within a system, attributes and operations and the relationship between each class. Classes are grouped together to create class diagrams when diagramming large systems.
- [`Component Diagram`](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-component-diagram) Displays the structural relationship of software system elements, most often employed when working with complex systems with multiple components. Components communicate using interfaces.
- [`Composite Structure Diagram`](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-composite-structure-diagram) Composite structure diagrams are used to show the internal structure of a class.
Deployment Diagram Illustrates system hardware and its software. Useful when a software solution is deployed across multiple machines with unique configurations.
- [`Object Diagram`](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-deployment-diagram) Shows the relationship between objects using real world examples and illustrates how a system will look at any given time. Because data is available within objects, they can be used to clarify relationships between objects.
- [`Package Diagram`](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-package-diagram) There are two special types of dependencies defined between packages: package import and package merge. Packages can represent the different levels of a system to reveal the architecture. Package dependencies can be marked to show the communication mechanism between levels.

2. **Behavioral UML diagrams**
- [`Activity Diagrams`](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-activity-diagram) Graphically represented business or operational workflows to show the activity of any part or component in the system. Activity diagrams are used as an alternative to State Machine diagrams.
- [`Communication Diagram`](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-communication-diagram) Similar to sequence diagrams, but the focus is on messages passed between objects. The same information can be represented using a sequence diagram and different objects.
- [`Interaction Overview Diagram`](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-interaction-diagram) There are seven types of interaction diagrams, and this diagram shows the sequence in which they act.
- [`Sequence Diagram`](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-sequence-diagram) Shows how objects interact with each other and the order of occurrence. They represent interactions for a particular scenario.
- [`State Diagram`](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-state-machine-diagram) Similar to activity diagrams, they describe the behavior of objects that behave in varying ways in their current state.
- [`Timing Diagram`](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-timing-diagram) Like Sequence Diagrams, the behavior of objects in a given time frame are represented. If there is a single object, the diagram is simple. With more than one object, interactions of objects are shown during that particular time frame.
- [`Use Case Diagram`](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/uml-use-case-diagram) Represents a particular functionality of a system, created to illustrate how functionalities relate and their internal/external controllers (actors).
